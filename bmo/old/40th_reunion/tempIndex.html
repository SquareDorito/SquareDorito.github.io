        <h1>40th Reunion Events</h1> 

        <br>

        <a>The 2015-2016 academic year represents the 40th season of Brown Ultimate! To celebrate this exciting milestone, the program will host two reunion events over the course of the year, and would like to invite all interested alumni to participate in the festivities. These events -- Huck a Hunk of Burning Pumpkin and Commencement Weekend -- are described in detail below. If you are interested in attending one or both of these events, please fill out the form at the bottom of this page.</a>

        <br><br><br>
        
        <h2>Huck a Hunk of Burning Pumpkin</h2>
        <br>
        <a>
            <b>Date: </b>October 23-25, 2015
            <br><b>Location: </b>Tournament Location TBD, and Brown University 
            <br><br> Huck a Hunk is the annual Brown Ultimate fall home tournament. In past years, HHBP has served as a reunion weekend for alumni who have graduated recently enough to be aware of the tournament. This year, we would like to invite everyone who has played a role in shaping our amazing program to join us in the fall to kick off celebration of the team's 40th season. This weekend will include the traditional BMo vs. alumni game at the tournament, at least one alumni dinner, and plenty of opportunities to meet fellow alumni and cheer for the current BMo team as we take on regional competitors on our home turf.
